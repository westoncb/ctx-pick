`ctx-pick` is a handy command-line utility that gathers file contents, formats them into a single Markdown string, and copies it to your clipboard. It's designed to make it easy to provide code context to Large Language Models (LLMs).

It intelligently finds files based on direct paths, directory names, or even partial file names, then reports on what it found before copying the final context.

---

## Features

- **Flexible File Selection**: Specify files by direct path (`src/main.rs`), directory (`src/`), or unique partial names (`main`, `display`).
- **Recursive Search**: Automatically searches subdirectories to find files based on your input.
- **Smart Conflict Resolution**: If a partial name is ambiguous (e.g., `lib` matches `src/lib.rs` and `tests/lib.rs`), it will alert you and list the conflicting paths.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copies the generated Markdown context directly to your system's clipboard.
- **Fallback to Standard Output**: If clipboard access fails, it prints the full context to `stdout` so you can still pipe or copy it manually.
- **Informative Previews**: Before copying, it shows a summary of the files and line counts included in the context.
- **Clear Error Reporting**: Provides detailed, color-coded feedback for files that are not found, paths that don't exist, or ambiguous inputs.

## Installation

You can install `ctx-pick` directly from Crates.io using Cargo:

```sh
cargo install ctx-pick
```

---

## Usage

The basic command structure is to provide a space-separated list of files, directories, or partial names.

```sh
ctx-pick [INPUTS]...
```

### Examples

**1. Pick specific files by path:**

```sh
ctx-pick src/main.rs src/types.rs
```

**2. Grab all files within a directory:**

```sh
# This will recursively find all files in the 'src' directory
ctx-pick src
```

**3. Use partial file names:**

> `ctx-pick` will find files that contain the input string. It prioritizes exact filename matches over partial ones.

```sh
# Assuming 'main.rs' and 'display.rs' are the only files containing these strings
ctx-pick main display
```

**4. Combine all methods:**

```sh
# Gets lib.rs, all files in the 'tests' dir, and the file matching 'config'
ctx-pick src/lib.rs tests config
```

### Example Output

If successful, `ctx-pick` will report its actions to `stderr` and copy the context to your clipboard.

```sh
$ ctx-pick src/config.rs src/error.rs
âœ… Context copied to clipboard (2 files, 23 lines)
========================================
Included files:

1. src/config.rs
   ðŸ“„ 20 lines
2. src/error.rs
   ðŸ“„ 3 lines

========================================
```

The content copied to the clipboard will be formatted in Markdown like this:

src/config.rs

```rust
use crate::error::AppError; // We'll define this in the next step
use std::env;
// ... (rest of file content) ...
```

src/error.rs

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

\#[derive(Error, Debug)]
// ... (rest of file content) ...
```
